Snapik
======

Snapik is an app for Google Glass that allows users to take hands-free pictures that can be used in vignettes.

#### Usage

Either sideload the prebuilt apk [available here] (https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B59-w0gvh0SeYi1VM3RTeVBTQkE/edit?usp=sharing), or clone this repository and build and install it as usual. Once the app is 
installed it is available in the voice menu as 'snap a picture'. When the picture appears in the timeline tap on the touchpad 
and select the option 'Make vignette'.
